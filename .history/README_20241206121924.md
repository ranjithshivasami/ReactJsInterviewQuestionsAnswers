# ReactJsInterviewQuestions
Here are detailed answers for the **React Basics** questions:

---

### **1. What is React, and why is it used?**
React is a **JavaScript library** developed by Facebook for building **user interfaces**, especially for single-page applications. It is used to:
- **Build dynamic web applications**: React updates and renders only the necessary parts of the UI, making it efficient for interactive interfaces.
- **Component-based architecture**: Code can be broken into reusable pieces, simplifying development and testing.
- **Declarative UI**: Developers define the UI, and React ensures it reflects the underlying application state.

---

### **2. What are the major features of React?**
Key features of React include:
1. **Declarative UI**: Describes what the UI should look like for a given state.
2. **Component-based architecture**: Encapsulates logic and UI into reusable building blocks.
3. **Virtual DOM**: Minimizes updates to the real DOM for better performance.
4. **Unidirectional data flow**: Ensures a predictable data structure with controlled state management.
5. **JSX syntax**: Allows writing HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript.
6. **Rich ecosystem**: Includes hooks, libraries like React Router, and tools like Redux for state management.

---

### **3. What is JSX?**
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a **syntax extension for JavaScript** that looks like HTML. It allows developers to write UI components in a way that closely resembles HTML.

For example:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```
JSX is transformed into JavaScript by tools like Babel:
```javascript
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');
```

---

### **4. Why can’t browsers read JSX directly?**
Browsers can’t read JSX because it is not valid JavaScript. JSX needs to be **transpiled** into JavaScript code using tools like **Babel** or **Webpack** before browsers can interpret it.

For instance:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```
is transpiled to:
```javascript
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');
```

---

### **5. What is the Virtual DOM?**
The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. It is a **JavaScript object** that React uses to optimize updates to the real DOM.

**How it works**:
1. When the state of a component changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree.
2. React compares the new tree with the previous one (a process called **reconciliation**).
3. React updates only the necessary elements in the real DOM.

This minimizes direct manipulation of the real DOM, improving performance.

---

### **6. Explain the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.**

| **Feature**          | **Real DOM**                              | **Virtual DOM**                          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Update**            | Updates the entire tree                  | Updates only the changed elements        |
| **Performance**       | Slow due to direct manipulation          | Fast due to minimal DOM operations       |
| **Usage**             | Standard in web development              | Used internally by React for optimization|
| **Cost**              | More memory-intensive due to large trees | Lightweight JavaScript objects           |

---

### **7. What are React components?**
React components are **independent, reusable pieces of UI** that return JSX to render.

Example of a component:
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```
Types of components:
1. **Functional components**: Use functions to define UI.
2. **Class components**: Use ES6 classes to define UI.

---

### **8. What are the types of components in React?**
React components can be broadly classified into:

1. **Functional Components**:
   - Written as JavaScript functions.
   - Can use hooks for state and lifecycle management.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     function Greeting(props) {
       return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
     }
     ```

2. **Class Components**:
   - Defined as ES6 classes.
   - Use lifecycle methods and `this.state` for state management.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     class Greeting extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
       }
     }
     ```

---

### **9. What is the difference between a functional and a class component?**

| **Aspect**            | **Functional Component**                  | **Class Component**                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | JavaScript function                      | ES6 class                                |
| **State Management**   | Uses `useState` and other hooks          | Uses `this.state`                        |
| **Lifecycle Methods**  | Uses hooks like `useEffect`              | Uses methods like `componentDidMount`    |
| **Performance**        | Faster and simpler                       | Slightly slower due to `this` binding    |
| **Syntax**             | Concise and modern                       | Verbose                                  |

---

### **10. What is the significance of the `key` prop in React?**
The `key` prop is used by React to identify elements in a list. It helps React efficiently update and render components.

**Why it’s important**:
- Helps React track changes (additions, removals, or reorders) in a list.
- Improves performance during reconciliation.

Example:
```jsx
const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
const list = items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);
```

**Best practices**:
- Use a unique and stable identifier (e.g., database IDs) as the `key`.
- Avoid using array indices as keys unless the list is static.

--- 


### **11. What is state in React?**
State is a built-in object in React used to store and manage data that changes over time in a component. It is:
- **Mutable**: Can be updated within the component.
- **Component-specific**: Each component has its own state.
- Used to trigger re-renders when updated.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### **12. What are props in React?**
Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another, typically from a parent to a child. They are:
- **Immutable**: Cannot be modified by the receiving component.
- **Read-only**: Used to configure or display data within a child component.

Example:
```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="John" />;
}
```

---

### **13. What is the difference between state and props?**

| **Aspect**            | **State**                                 | **Props**                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Internal data managed by a component      | Data passed to a component from its parent |
| **Mutability**         | Mutable (can be updated)                 | Immutable (read-only)                    |
| **Scope**              | Local to the component                   | Can be accessed by child components      |
| **Usage**              | Used for dynamic data                    | Used to pass data between components     |

---

### **14. Can you modify props in React?**
No, props are **read-only** and cannot be modified by the receiving component. Attempting to modify props results in an error. Props ensure that components remain predictable and follow React’s unidirectional data flow.

For instance:
```jsx
function Child(props) {
  // This is not allowed:
  // props.name = 'New Name';
  
  return <h1>{props.name}</h1>;
}
```

If you need to modify the data, manage it in the parent component's state and pass it down as props.

---

### **15. How do you pass data from a parent to a child component?**
Data is passed from a parent to a child component using **props**. 

Example:
```jsx
function Child(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function Parent() {
  return <Child name="Alice" />;
}
```
In this case, the `Parent` component passes the `name` prop to the `Child` component.

---

### **16. How do you manage state in a functional component?**
Functional components use the `useState` hook to manage state. The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements:
1. The current state.
2. A function to update the state.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### **17. What is the use of `useState` in React?**
The `useState` hook is used in functional components to manage state. It allows you to:
- Declare state variables.
- Update the state.
- Trigger re-renders when state changes.

Example:
```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```
Where:
- `state` is the current state value.
- `setState` is a function used to update the state.

---

### **18. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?**

| **Aspect**            | **Controlled Component**                  | **Uncontrolled Component**               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Component controls the input's value     | DOM manages the input's value            |
| **Data Source**        | State in React                           | Reference to the DOM element             |
| **Example**            | `<input value={value} onChange={handler}/>` | `<input defaultValue="value" />`        |
| **Use Case**           | Preferred for form validation            | Used for simpler scenarios               |

Controlled Component Example:
```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  
  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

Uncontrolled Component Example:
```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = React.useRef();
  
  return <input defaultValue="Default" ref={inputRef} />;
}
```

---

### **19. How do you lift state up in React?**
Lifting state up means moving the shared state to the nearest common ancestor of components that need access to it. This approach ensures that components receive data via props.

Example:
```jsx
function Parent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildA value={value} setValue={setValue} />
      <ChildB value={value} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildA({ value, setValue }) {
  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}

function ChildB({ value }) {
  return <p>{value}</p>;
}
```

---

### **20. What is the purpose of default props in React?**
Default props are used to set default values for props when they are not explicitly provided. This ensures that the component has meaningful values even if the parent does not pass props.

Example:
```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Guest',
};
```
Here, if `name` is not passed, it defaults to `'Guest'`.

---
### **3. Lifecycle Methods**


---

### **21. What are React lifecycle methods?**
React lifecycle methods are special methods that get called at different stages of a component’s life: from creation to update and finally to removal from the DOM. These methods allow you to run specific code at various points in the component’s lifecycle. In class components, lifecycle methods are integral to managing side effects, such as fetching data, updating the UI, and cleaning up resources.

### **22. List the phases of the React component lifecycle.**
React component lifecycle is divided into three main phases:
1. **Mounting**: The phase when the component is being created and inserted into the DOM. Lifecycle methods: `constructor`, `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `render`, `componentDidMount`.
2. **Updating**: The phase when a component’s state or props change, leading to a re-render. Lifecycle methods: `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `render`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate`.
3. **Unmounting**: The phase when the component is being removed from the DOM. Lifecycle method: `componentWillUnmount`.

---

### **23. What is the `componentDidMount` method used for?**
The `componentDidMount` method is called once, immediately after the component is mounted (added to the DOM). It is commonly used for:
- **Data fetching**: Making API calls.
- **Event listeners**: Adding event listeners or subscriptions.
- **Setting up external libraries**: For example, initializing third-party libraries.
  
Example:
```jsx
componentDidMount() {
  fetch('/api/data')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => this.setState({ data }));
}
```

---

### **24. What is the purpose of `shouldComponentUpdate`?**
The `shouldComponentUpdate` method allows you to prevent unnecessary re-renders by comparing the current and next props or state. It returns a boolean value (`true` to update, `false` to skip the update). It’s particularly useful for performance optimization.

Example:
```jsx
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  if (this.state.count === nextState.count) {
    return false;  // Prevent re-render if the count hasn't changed
  }
  return true;
}
```

---

### **25. What happens in the `componentWillUnmount` method?**
The `componentWillUnmount` method is called just before a component is removed from the DOM. This is the ideal place to:
- **Clean up timers**: Clear intervals or timeouts.
- **Remove event listeners**: Unsubscribe from external libraries or remove event listeners.
- **Cancel network requests**: If necessary, abort or cancel API calls.

Example:
```jsx
componentWillUnmount() {
  clearInterval(this.timerID);  // Clear any ongoing timer
}
```

---

### **26. How is the `getDerivedStateFromProps` method used?**
The `getDerivedStateFromProps` method is a static method that gets called before every render, both when the component is receiving new props and when the state is updated. It allows you to update the state based on the incoming props. This is a replacement for the old `componentWillReceiveProps` method.

It has the following signature:
```jsx
static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, nextState) {
  // Logic to update state based on props
  return { derivedState: nextProps.value };
}
```

---

### **27. What replaced `componentWillReceiveProps` in React 16.3?**
In React 16.3, `componentWillReceiveProps` was deprecated and replaced with the `getDerivedStateFromProps` method. While `componentWillReceiveProps` was invoked before each render when props changed, `getDerivedStateFromProps` is now the preferred way to manage state updates based on props changes in class components.

---

### **28. What is the difference between `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUpdate`?**

| **Aspect**              | **componentDidUpdate**                        | **componentWillUpdate**                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **When it's called**    | After the component has re-rendered (post-update) | Before the component re-renders (pre-update) |
| **Purpose**              | Used to perform side effects after updates (e.g., fetching new data, updating the DOM) | Deprecated in React 16.3; not used anymore |
| **Availability of props/state** | Both the current and previous props/state are available | Only the next props/state are available |

`componentWillUpdate` is deprecated because it can lead to potential issues with async rendering, so `componentDidUpdate` is preferred for performing tasks after updates.

---

### **29. Can you use lifecycle methods in functional components?**
No, lifecycle methods are specific to **class components**. However, in **functional components**, React introduced **hooks** that replicate lifecycle behaviors. The most commonly used hook for lifecycle-like behavior is `useEffect`.

For example:
- **componentDidMount** → `useEffect` with an empty dependency array (`[]`).
- **componentDidUpdate** → `useEffect` with dependencies.
- **componentWillUnmount** → Return a cleanup function inside `useEffect`.

Example of `useEffect`:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs once after the component mounts
  fetchData();
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code, runs when the component unmounts
    cancelFetchRequest();
  };
}, []);  // Empty array means it runs only once
```

---

### **30. How do React hooks replace lifecycle methods?**

React hooks were introduced to handle side effects and lifecycle-related logic in **functional components**. They offer a more concise and reusable way of managing lifecycle behaviors:

- **`useEffect`**: Replaces several lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
  - **`componentDidMount`**: Use `useEffect` with an empty dependency array (`[]`).
  - **`componentDidUpdate`**: Use `useEffect` with specific dependencies.
  - **`componentWillUnmount`**: Use the cleanup function returned by `useEffect`.
  
Example:
```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // This acts like componentDidMount
    console.log('Component mounted');

    return () => {
      // This acts like componentWillUnmount
      console.log('Component unmounted');
    };
  }, []);  // Empty array means it runs once after the initial render

  return <div>Example Component</div>;
}
```
