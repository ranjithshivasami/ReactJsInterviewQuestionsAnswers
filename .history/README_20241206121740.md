# ReactJsInterviewQuestions
Here are detailed answers for the **React Basics** questions:

---

### **1. What is React, and why is it used?**
React is a **JavaScript library** developed by Facebook for building **user interfaces**, especially for single-page applications. It is used to:
- **Build dynamic web applications**: React updates and renders only the necessary parts of the UI, making it efficient for interactive interfaces.
- **Component-based architecture**: Code can be broken into reusable pieces, simplifying development and testing.
- **Declarative UI**: Developers define the UI, and React ensures it reflects the underlying application state.

---

### **2. What are the major features of React?**
Key features of React include:
1. **Declarative UI**: Describes what the UI should look like for a given state.
2. **Component-based architecture**: Encapsulates logic and UI into reusable building blocks.
3. **Virtual DOM**: Minimizes updates to the real DOM for better performance.
4. **Unidirectional data flow**: Ensures a predictable data structure with controlled state management.
5. **JSX syntax**: Allows writing HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript.
6. **Rich ecosystem**: Includes hooks, libraries like React Router, and tools like Redux for state management.

---

### **3. What is JSX?**
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a **syntax extension for JavaScript** that looks like HTML. It allows developers to write UI components in a way that closely resembles HTML.

For example:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```
JSX is transformed into JavaScript by tools like Babel:
```javascript
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');
```

---

### **4. Why can’t browsers read JSX directly?**
Browsers can’t read JSX because it is not valid JavaScript. JSX needs to be **transpiled** into JavaScript code using tools like **Babel** or **Webpack** before browsers can interpret it.

For instance:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```
is transpiled to:
```javascript
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');
```

---

### **5. What is the Virtual DOM?**
The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. It is a **JavaScript object** that React uses to optimize updates to the real DOM.

**How it works**:
1. When the state of a component changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree.
2. React compares the new tree with the previous one (a process called **reconciliation**).
3. React updates only the necessary elements in the real DOM.

This minimizes direct manipulation of the real DOM, improving performance.

---

### **6. Explain the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.**

| **Feature**          | **Real DOM**                              | **Virtual DOM**                          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Update**            | Updates the entire tree                  | Updates only the changed elements        |
| **Performance**       | Slow due to direct manipulation          | Fast due to minimal DOM operations       |
| **Usage**             | Standard in web development              | Used internally by React for optimization|
| **Cost**              | More memory-intensive due to large trees | Lightweight JavaScript objects           |

---

### **7. What are React components?**
React components are **independent, reusable pieces of UI** that return JSX to render.

Example of a component:
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```
Types of components:
1. **Functional components**: Use functions to define UI.
2. **Class components**: Use ES6 classes to define UI.

---

### **8. What are the types of components in React?**
React components can be broadly classified into:

1. **Functional Components**:
   - Written as JavaScript functions.
   - Can use hooks for state and lifecycle management.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     function Greeting(props) {
       return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
     }
     ```

2. **Class Components**:
   - Defined as ES6 classes.
   - Use lifecycle methods and `this.state` for state management.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     class Greeting extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
       }
     }
     ```

---

### **9. What is the difference between a functional and a class component?**

| **Aspect**            | **Functional Component**                  | **Class Component**                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | JavaScript function                      | ES6 class                                |
| **State Management**   | Uses `useState` and other hooks          | Uses `this.state`                        |
| **Lifecycle Methods**  | Uses hooks like `useEffect`              | Uses methods like `componentDidMount`    |
| **Performance**        | Faster and simpler                       | Slightly slower due to `this` binding    |
| **Syntax**             | Concise and modern                       | Verbose                                  |

---

### **10. What is the significance of the `key` prop in React?**
The `key` prop is used by React to identify elements in a list. It helps React efficiently update and render components.

**Why it’s important**:
- Helps React track changes (additions, removals, or reorders) in a list.
- Improves performance during reconciliation.

Example:
```jsx
const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
const list = items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);
```

**Best practices**:
- Use a unique and stable identifier (e.g., database IDs) as the `key`.
- Avoid using array indices as keys unless the list is static.

### **11. What is state in React?**
State is a built-in object in React used to store and manage data that changes over time in a component. It is:
- **Mutable**: Can be updated within the component.
- **Component-specific**: Each component has its own state.
- Used to trigger re-renders when updated.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### **12. What are props in React?**
Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another, typically from a parent to a child. They are:
- **Immutable**: Cannot be modified by the receiving component.
- **Read-only**: Used to configure or display data within a child component.

Example:
```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="John" />;
}
```

---

### **13. What is the difference between state and props?**

| **Aspect**            | **State**                                 | **Props**                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Internal data managed by a component      | Data passed to a component from its parent |
| **Mutability**         | Mutable (can be updated)                 | Immutable (read-only)                    |
| **Scope**              | Local to the component                   | Can be accessed by child components      |
| **Usage**              | Used for dynamic data                    | Used to pass data between components     |

---

### **14. Can you modify props in React?**
No, props are **read-only** and cannot be modified by the receiving component. Attempting to modify props results in an error. Props ensure that components remain predictable and follow React’s unidirectional data flow.

For instance:
```jsx
function Child(props) {
  // This is not allowed:
  // props.name = 'New Name';
  
  return <h1>{props.name}</h1>;
}
```

If you need to modify the data, manage it in the parent component's state and pass it down as props.

---

### **15. How do you pass data from a parent to a child component?**
Data is passed from a parent to a child component using **props**. 

Example:
```jsx
function Child(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function Parent() {
  return <Child name="Alice" />;
}
```
In this case, the `Parent` component passes the `name` prop to the `Child` component.

---

### **16. How do you manage state in a functional component?**
Functional components use the `useState` hook to manage state. The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements:
1. The current state.
2. A function to update the state.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### **17. What is the use of `useState` in React?**
The `useState` hook is used in functional components to manage state. It allows you to:
- Declare state variables.
- Update the state.
- Trigger re-renders when state changes.

Example:
```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```
Where:
- `state` is the current state value.
- `setState` is a function used to update the state.

---

### **18. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?**

| **Aspect**            | **Controlled Component**                  | **Uncontrolled Component**               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Component controls the input's value     | DOM manages the input's value            |
| **Data Source**        | State in React                           | Reference to the DOM element             |
| **Example**            | `<input value={value} onChange={handler}/>` | `<input defaultValue="value" />`        |
| **Use Case**           | Preferred for form validation            | Used for simpler scenarios               |

Controlled Component Example:
```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  
  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

Uncontrolled Component Example:
```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = React.useRef();
  
  return <input defaultValue="Default" ref={inputRef} />;
}
```

---

### **19. How do you lift state up in React?**
Lifting state up means moving the shared state to the nearest common ancestor of components that need access to it. This approach ensures that components receive data via props.

Example:
```jsx
function Parent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildA value={value} setValue={setValue} />
      <ChildB value={value} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildA({ value, setValue }) {
  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}

function ChildB({ value }) {
  return <p>{value}</p>;
}
```

---

### **20. What is the purpose of default props in React?**
Default props are used to set default values for props when they are not explicitly provided. This ensures that the component has meaningful values even if the parent does not pass props.

Example:
```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Guest',
};
```
Here, if `name` is not passed, it defaults to `'Guest'`.
